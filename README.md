Hydroscan: Smart Water Pollution Monitoring System
Hydroscan is an IoT-based device designed to monitor water quality in real time. It uses multiple sensors to track water pollution levels, transmitting data via LoRa and Wi-Fi to a cloud-based platform for live monitoring. The device is powered by ESP32 and provides valuable insights to detect pollution early and take preventive measures.

Features
Real-time monitoring of water quality parameters: pH, turbidity, TDS.
Long-range data transmission using LoRa technology.
Wi-Fi integration for cloud data storage and visualization.
Alerts and notifications for abnormal readings.
Low-power design suitable for remote locations.

Components
ESP32 Microcontroller: Handles data processing and communication.
LoRa Module: Provides long-range, low-power data transmission.
Sensors:
pH sensor
Turbidity sensor
TDS sensor
IoT Platform: For data storage, visualization, and analysis (e.g., ThingsBoard, Blynk).


How It Works
Data Collection: Sensors gather real-time data on water quality parameters like pH, turbidity, and TDS.
Transmission: Data is sent from the device via LoRa to the receiver, which is connected to Wi-Fi.
Cloud Integration: The receiver uploads the data to an IoT platform, where it can be visualized in real-time on a custom dashboard.
Alerts: The system sends notifications for any abnormal readings or water quality concerns.

Usage
Connect the Hydroscan device in a water body to measure water quality parameters.
View real-time data on the chosen IoT platform dashboard.
Set up alerts to receive notifications when water quality drops below safe levels.
